# Parasyte

## Overview

Parasyte is an educational and research-oriented project designed to simulate the behavior and propagation mechanisms of worm malware. This project aims to deepen the understanding of cybersecurity threats and develop strategies for defense and mitigation. It covers the workflow, architecture, and simulation of a worm within a controlled environment.

The codebase is structured to reflect best practices in software development, applying SOLID principles for modularity and maintainability. This project is intended strictly for academic and defensive cybersecurity research purposes.

## Features

- Network scanning simulation to identify vulnerable targets.
- Exploit mechanism simulations for educational purposes.
- Payload delivery and execution in a controlled environment.
- Detailed logging and analysis tools for educational insights.
- Modular architecture for easy extension and study.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (GCC recommended)
- Make (for building the project)
- VirtualBox or any virtual machine software (for creating isolated test environments)
